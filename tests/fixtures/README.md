# Test Fixtures

Small, static files committed to the repo so that CI can run tests without
external dependencies (checkpoints, datasets, network access, etc.).

## Guidelines

- Keep files small — configs, sample data, mock inputs, etc. are all fine.
- Do **not** commit large binaries (model weights, `.safetensors`, `.bin`).
- Organize by feature or test in descriptive subdirectories.
- Reference in tests via relative path: `Path(__file__).parent... / "fixtures" / "subdir"`.
